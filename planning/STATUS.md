# Planning Status

Master index of tracked planning work in PHX. Update when a unit of work is added, changes status, or is folded back into `context/`/`docs/`.

_Last updated: 2026-07-15_

## Active / current work

| Item | Kind | Status | Pointer |
|------|------|--------|---------|
| _(none tracked here yet)_ | | | |

## Note on legacy dated notes

Historical working notes live in the gitignored `plans/<YYYYMMDD>/` folders (e.g. pydantic-v2 migration, METr-JSON exporter, excel-interop refactor). Those are scratch/reference, not tracked planning — new tracked work should use `features/`/`refactor/` here.

## Update rule

When an item reaches `Complete`, fold its outcome into the relevant `context/` doc (or authoritative `docs/` deep-dive), then move its folder to `archive/<slug>/` and add a row to `archive/README.md`.
